	<p>Creating this form, was my first experiance with JQuery. I had a lot of time spent on google trying to figure out simple things. I have figured out that is how I learn best, figuering stuff out the hard way. Once I started to get used to the differences in the syntax between javascript and JQuery it really started to become easy. To validate the email address I dived into the world of regex, which was difficult to wrap my head around first, but once it clicked it all made sense. </p>
